            <p>Welcome to ScanMark. By accessing our website or using our mobile application (the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, you may not access the Service.</p>

            <h2>1. Use of Service</h2>
            <p>ScanMark is designed to facilitate attendance tracking for educational institutions. Users are divided into two categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lecturers:</strong> Authorized to create courses, generate QR codes, and export data.</li>
                <li><strong>Students:</strong> Authorized to scan codes to mark their own presence.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Academic Integrity & Anti-Spoofing</h2>
            <p>ScanMark is built on trust. You agree not to misuse the Service to falsify attendance records. Specifically, you agree NOT to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send screenshots of dynamic QR codes to students who are not physically present in the classroom ("Proxy Attendance").</li>
                <li>Attempt to bypass the geo-fencing or device-fingerprinting security measures.</li>
                <li>Scan a code on behalf of another student.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Violation Policy:</strong> We reserve the right to permanently suspend the account of any user found manipulating attendance data. We may also report such activity to the relevant university authorities upon request.</p>

            <h2>3. Accounts and Subscriptions</h2>
            <h3>3.1 Free Trial & Billing</h3>
            <p>Certain aspects of the Service are provided for a fee (e.g., "Lecturer Pro"). Paid subscriptions are billed in advance on a monthly or annual basis. You may cancel your subscription at any time; however, there are <strong>no refunds</strong> for partial months used.</p>
            
            <h3>3.2 Account Security</h3>
            <p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service. ScanMark cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</p>

            <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>The Service and its original content (excluding Content provided by users), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of ScanMark and its licensors. The Service is protected by copyright and trademark laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.</p>

            <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>In no event shall ScanMark, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service;</li>
                <li>Any conduct or content of any third party on the Service;</li>
                <li><strong>Academic disputes:</strong> ScanMark provides data "as is." We are not responsible for grading decisions, course failures, or administrative penalties resulting from attendance data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the <strong>Federal Republic of Nigeria</strong>, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

            <h2>7. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.</p>
